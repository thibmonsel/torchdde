        **Arguments:**

        - `func`: Pytorch model, i.e vector field
        - `t`: Current time step `t`
        - `y`: Current state `y`
        - `dt`: Step size `dt`
        - `has_aux`: Whether the model has an auxiliary output.

        ??? tip "has_aux ?"

            A function with an auxiliary output can look like
            ```python
            def f(t,y,args):
                return -y, ("Hello World",1)
            ```
            This `kwargs` argument is used to compute the adjoint method

        **Returns:**

        - The value of the solution at `t+dt`.
        - A local error estimate made during the step. (Used by
        [`torchdde.AdaptiveStepSizeController`][] controllers to change the step size.)
        It may be `None` for constant stepsize solvers for example.
        - Dictionary that holds all the information needed to properly
        build the interpolation between `t` and `t+dt`.
        - None if the model doesn't have an auxiliary output.
